            <p><strong>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</strong></p>
            <p>I decided on the content by first outlining the necessary sections based on the project brief (Home, Services, Contact). For images, I wanted a clean, professional look that avoided stock photo clichés. I used a mix of royalty-free images from Unsplash and a few custom graphics to match the site's dark, modern aesthetic. I made sure all images were optimized for web use right from the start.</p>

            <p><strong>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</strong></p>
            <p>Communication primarily happened over text and email. It was pretty efficient. I think the only issue was that they're should have been MORE communication. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be reminding her to finish the project or be critiquing her work. Didn't seem like the css for the cite ever got done though.</p>

            <p><strong>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</strong></p>
            <p>Somewhat. I feel like she had a great start with the beginning of the project. From what I saw the html for the site looked really good! It's just the css wasn't really done at all, and that's honestly the whole site in my opinion because it's what makes everything look remotely like a presentable website.</p>

            <p><strong>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</strong></p>
            <p>Next time, I would write much clearer requirements for specific interactions, like exact hover states or animation speeds. I was a bit vague on those details initially, which led to a few unnecessary back-and-forths during the implementation phase.</p>

            <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
            
            <p><strong>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?</strong></p>
            <p>I managed the team by assigning certain components to each junior developer. Communication for tasks was done through short, daily stand-up messages in our group chat.</p>

            <p><strong>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</strong></p>
            <p>I communicated with the client through email for formal approvals and updates. She was great at giving feedback. The only small hiccup was translating a few vague design requests ("make it pop more") into actionable CSS tasks, but we used design examples to clarify quickly.</p>

            <p><strong>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</strong></p>
            <p>I set up the repository on GitHub and used GitHub Pages for deployment. Once the site was finalized on the main branch, I sent the client the direct GitHub Pages URL and a brief set of instructions on how to navigate it, ensuring they could access it immediately.</p>

            <p><strong>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</strong></p>
            <p>GitHub was mostly smooth, but challenging when merging features from junior devs who didn't pull the latest main branch first. I had to practice handling merge conflicts more than I expected, but it was a good learning experience in keeping the repository clean.</p>

            <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
            
            <p><strong>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</strong></p>
            <p>I communicated with my team lead via a group chat. It was very easy; I would just send a screenshot or a quick question when I ran into a blocker. The lead was quick to respond, so we didn't have any major communication issues.</p>

            <p><strong>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, for the most part. The tasks were clear and broken down well." There were a couple of times I had to double-check the exact required dimensions for an element, but generally, the expectations were straightforward.</p>

            <p><strong>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</strong></p>
            <p>I contributed styling and responsiveness to the main landing page, and also built the basic HTML structure for the 'About Us' page. On the second project, I handled all the CSS for the image gallery. I felt like I was able to make meaningful contributions to both teams.</p>

            <p><strong>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, I ran into a couple of issues. The first time, I pushed my changes to the wrong branch, which was easy to fix. The second time, I got a conflict when pulling the main branch. I had to look up the steps for resolving a merge conflict, but after that, pushing and pulling became much simpler.</p>

            <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
            
            <p><strong>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</strong></p>
            <p>The most challenging part was dealing with the responsive navigation bar. Making sure the menu buttons linked to all the other pages correctly took me way longer to figure out than it should have. I got it eventually though.</p>

            <p><strong>What did you enjoy most about this project?</strong></p>
            <p>I really enjoyed the design aspect, especially the portion where I just got to mess around with the css to try and match the clients desired design. The moment the site went live on GitHub Pages and actually looked good on my pc was definitely the most satisfying part.</p>

            <p><strong>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</strong></p>
            <p>I would focus on planning the CSS structure more rigorously before writing any code. I jumped right into styling a few times and ended up rewriting large blocks of CSS because my initial class names weren't scalable. I would use a more systematic approach next time.</p>

            <p><strong>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, definitely. Before this, HTML and CSS felt like abstract skills, but having to work with a team, manage files on GitHub, and meet a client's specific needs made it feel like a real job. The whole process of planning, executing, and deploying built a lot of confidence in my ability to handle full-scale web projects.</p>
