                        <h3>Apostle Spotlight</h3>
                        <p>For this project, I created a simple HTML page focused on displaying a hierarchy of religious leaders. I learned a lot about fundamental CSS layout here. The main challenge was using a system like Flexbox or Grid to keep the entire content block centered and ensure all the circular profile pictures were perfectly aligned in their rows. Getting the images to be clean circles using the border-radius property was also a key takeawa</p>

                        <h3>Favorite Devo</h3>
                        <p>What I really got out of this project was mastering HTML tables. I learned the proper structure using tags like table, thead, tr, and th to set up clear columns for Speaker, Title, Location, and Year. Beyond the basic structure, I also had to use CSS to make the table look decent—like getting the borders right and making sure the whole table was neatly centered on the page. It was a good lesson in making raw data digestible and organized.</p>

                        <h3>Gallery</h3>
                        <p>This project, which I called the Christ Art Gallery, was all about setting up a clean, visually focused image grid. The biggest thing I learned here was how to use CSS Grid to handle multiple items. My goal was to arrange all those paintings into a perfect 3x4 layout so they lined up exactly, which was great practice in mastering grid properties like grid-template-columns. I also had to make sure the images themselves were responsive, scaling down neatly for different screen sizes, and that white border around the whole thing really made me focus on getting the main container's CSS styling precise.</p>

                        <h3>Grid Flags</h3>
                        <p>This was the project where I used CSS Grid to build a bunch of country flags. The main thing I learned was how powerful CSS Grid is for precise positioning. Instead of using pictures, I had to use different colored boxes (div elements) and then use grid rules to stack and line them up exactly right to form flags like Denmark and Benin. It was a tough but good lesson in building detailed graphics using only HTML and CSS.</p>

                        <h3>Positioning</h3>
                        <p>his project was a series of exercises to practice CSS positioning. I spent my time here learning how the different position settings like absolute and relative actually work. I had to use properties like top, left, and bottom to move the colored boxes around so they landed in the exact spots I needed them to be. This was great for learning how to control the location and stacking of every single item on a webpage.</p>

                        <h3>Prophet Cards</h3>
                        <p>This project was all about building a single profile card for Russell M. Nelson. I got good practice at using CSS to design a clean, distinct block of content. I had to focus on things like setting the background colors, applying border-radius to round the corners of the card, and making sure all the text and the image were neatly organized and centered inside that colored box. It was a solid exercise in making a clean, contained UI component.</p>

                        <h3>Signup Form</h3>
                        <p>This final sign-up form was the ultimate test because it required combining everything. I used basic HTML to structure all the inputs and buttons. Then, I used CSS layout techniques to build the entire thing into that clean, centered card component, mastering both the structure of the form elements and the styling of the overall interface design.</p>
